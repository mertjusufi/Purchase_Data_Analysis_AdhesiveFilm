# Purchase Data Analysis - Adhesive Film
Welcome to my repository for the analysis of purchase data for Self-adhesive Vinyl Films. This Python-based project offers several features to extract and visualize meaningful insights from the purchasing data.

# Project Overview
The project revolves around the analysis of purchases related to Self-adhesive Vinyl Films. The analysis offers:

Statistical Profiling: Provides basic statistical insights such as mean, median, mode, standard deviation, variance, minimum, and maximum of purchase quantities.

Product Analysis: Identification of top and bottom products in terms of purchases, visualized using bar plots for quick insights.

Sales Concentration: Calculation of sales concentration to see what percentage of total purchases top products account for.

ABC Classification: Based on the Pareto principle, this categorizes products into A, B, and C classes based on cumulative purchase quantities.

Outlier Detection: Detects outliers in purchase quantities using the Z-score method.

Fast/Slow Moving Items: Identification and visualization of fast and slow-moving items based on purchase quantities.
